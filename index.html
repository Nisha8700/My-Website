                         <p>For India to switch over to digital payments, most vendors and merchants will have to offer such options. And even the big mobile wallets, which offer the most range of digital payment options in India at the moment, know this. For instance, after Demonetisation, MobiKwik tied up with a representative body for 30 lakh street vendors and launched a data-light version of their app for vendors. Similarly, other players have been aggressively training and encouraging shop and business owners to offer their services as an option.
                            The experience of using a mobile wallet can be a little different for vendors than it is for regular users. From documentation, caps on money that can be stored to transaction charges, here is what vendors need to know about mobile wallets.<br><br>
          
                            Companies specialized in payments, such as Worldline, forecast that mobile payments (m-payments) will triple in the coming years. The transition to digital payments, or cashless payments, varies depending on the country. In some, such as Switzerland, Belgium or South Korea, the "cashless" revolution appeared very quickly. In other regions, this change is slower for cultural, social and economic reasons. Nevertheless, the trend is clear: regardless of the payment culture, the ratio of liquidity used to the volume of payment transactions continues to fall.
